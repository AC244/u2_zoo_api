## Introduction
- We have now seen how to hold related data with full CRUD functionality on a database server using controllers to keep our data clean and organized
- Lets create a database with two related models, giving full CRUD to each of them

## Set Up
- You tell us! What files, directories, and other prep work will we need to create and brainstorm to get this working?
- Use previous lessons, labs, and HWs that you have completed as a guide!

## Requirements
- Your db should have two related objects, Type, and Animals. At least 3 Types with at least 3 Animal objects inside of each
- Your types will be Reptile, Bird, and Mammal, and will hold an index of your Animal objects. (You can do Fish or Insect if you'd like instead of course)
- Animals should have the following properties : Name, scientific name, region, image url, and anything else you can think of
- All models should have full CRUD functionality with Thunder Client
